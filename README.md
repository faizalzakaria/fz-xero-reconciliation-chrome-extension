# Xero Reconcilation tools.

## Introduction

Xero is great, but it has its own limitation. To reconcile a payment will require full attention from the user, to avoid any reconcilation error. 

But for payment that is consistent, that is processed by a gateway, with a proper reference, then this job is redundant and repetitive.

This chrome extension is to help facilitate this repetitive work. All you have to do is just trigger this extension and it will try to read the reference from
the bank statement and match with the correct transaction, and auto reconcile it. It simulates the whole thing, from searching the right transaction reference
to reconcilation.

## How To

Install this chrome extension, and go to xero reconilation page, and trigger this extension. For now it will only process 10 transactions per cycle.
